# Maggie Project

This is a project to validate some best practices in software development. Basically, there are two applications, which one is responsible by the backend, providing some rest apis and the another one is responsible to render the data in HTML pages, which is, the frontend layer.

The principal technologies used in this project are: [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/).
